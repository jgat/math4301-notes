\section{About}

It is the author's intention that these notes, and the $\LaTeX$ source code, be
publicly released and made available for future reference, so this section
records notes about these notes.

At time of writing, this document can be found at \url{\thisurl}, and its
source code can be found at \url{\sourceurl}.

The 2013 offering of MATH4301 Advanced Algebra was divided into two halves, the
first half on Galois Theory, taught by Victor Scharaschkin, and the second half
on Coxeter Groups, taught by Ole Warnaar. Each half of the course was
accompanied by an assignment worth $20\%$ of the grade, and an exam worth
$30\%$ of the grade.

This document contains detailed lecture notes taken during the
second half of the course. The notes correspond closely to what was written
and said in lectures.
Each section within this document corresponds to notes taken in a single
lecture.
